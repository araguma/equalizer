# Chrome Equalizer Extension

I created this extension mainly for personal use after having to deal with two extension hijacking attacks, but feel free to use it if you somehow ended up in this repository looking for an equalizer extension.

## Features

- Dynamic band adjustment from 32 Hz to 16384 Hz
- Toggle on and off mono audio
- Switch left and right channels
- Preset band adjustments

## Installation

1. Download the latest release on the right and unzip the file
2. Go to your Chrome extensions page
3. Turn on developer mode on the top right
4. Click on load unpacked and select the folder that you got from unzipping

## Roadmap

- More modifiers and presets
- UI redesign
- Code optimization
